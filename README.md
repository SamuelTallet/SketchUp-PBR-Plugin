- **Edit materials**

  - Mouse over question mark ❔ if you need help.

- **Open viewport**

  - Control camera with middle click and left drag.
  - Save render as image with right then left click...

- **Export as 3D object**

Known issues and workaround
---------------------------

Issue in PBR Viewport | Workaround
:--- | :---
Texture background is white instead of being transparent. | Open PBR Material Editor ("Extensions" > "Physically-Based Rendering" > "Edit Materials..."). Select material. Set "Alpha mode" to "Combined with background".
Texture is fully opaque whereas I set opacity to *n* %. | With your preferred photo editing software, set opacity **directly** to texture image. Use PNG as exchange format to preserve opacity. Reimport texture image in SketchUp.
Texture looks weird with perpendicular lines around. | With your preferred photo editing software, resize texture image to a [power of two](https://oeis.org/A000079/list) (e.g. *512x512*, *1024x1024*, *2048x2048*, *4096x4096*). Reimport texture image in SketchUp.
Orbit control doesn't obey. | Press <kbd>F11</kbd> to go fullscreen.

PBR plugin project would not have succeeded without: [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com), [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/), [glTF Export plugin](https://extensions.sketchup.com/content/gltf-exporter), [nginx](https://nginx.org) and [ClayGL library](http://claygl.xyz).
